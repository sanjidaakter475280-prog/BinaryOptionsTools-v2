## Installation

Add the crate to your `Cargo.toml` dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
binary_options_tools = "0.1.7" 
```

## Basic Usage

```rust
use binary_options_tools::PocketOption;
use std::time::Duration;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Initialize client with session ID
    let client = PocketOption::new("your_session_id").await?;
    
    // Wait for connection to be established
    tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(5)).await;
    
    // Get account balance
    let balance = client.balance().await;
    println!("Current balance: {}", balance);
    
    // Place a buy trade
    let (trade_id, deal) = client.buy("EURUSD_otc", 60, 1.0).await?;
    println!("Trade placed: {:?}", deal);
    
    // Check trade result
    let result = client.result(trade_id).await?;
    println!("Trade result: {:?}", result);
    
    // Subscribe to real-time data
    let subscription = client.subscribe("EURUSD_otc", SubscriptionType::None).await?;
    
    // Shutdown client
    client.shutdown().await?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```
